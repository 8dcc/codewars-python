  # Explanation of the complex operation I did here:
  #
  #Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol ×, by the mid-line dot operator ⋅, by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk *) is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the other ones being addition, subtraction, and division. The result of a multiplication operation is called a product.
  #
  #The multiplication of whole numbers may be thought of as a repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the quantity of the other one, the multiplier. Both numbers can be referred to as factors.
  #
  #{\displaystyle a\times b=\underbrace {b+\cdots +b} _{a{\text{ times}}}}{\displaystyle a\times b=\underbrace {b+\cdots +b} _{a{\text{ times}}}}
  #For example, 4 multiplied by 3, often written as {\displaystyle 3\times 4}3\times 4 and spoken as "3 times 4", can be calculated by adding 3 copies of 4 together:
  #
  #{\displaystyle 3\times 4=4+4+4=12}3\times 4=4+4+4=12
  #Here, 3 (the multiplier) and 4 (the multiplicand) are the factors, and 12 is the product.
  #
  #One of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property, which states in this case that adding 3 copies of 4 gives the same result as adding 4 copies of 3:
  #
  #{\displaystyle 4\times 3=3+3+3+3=12}4\times 3=3+3+3+3=12
  #Thus the designation of multiplier and multiplicand does not affect the result of the multiplication.[1]
